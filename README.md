I wanted to block Reddit and Hacker News on my phone but couldn't find any general-purpose domain blocking apps that I liked. So here's my take.

The app provides a Content Blocker extension which you have to enable in Safari preferences. You can then add/delete domains to block in the app. You can also use the Safari Action extension to add the website you're currently browsing to the blocklist.

# What's left to do

- [x] Ability to edit a domain
- [ ] Move shared code into its own .framework
- [ ] Polish up the UI: give it some colour, some app icons, a welcome screen, an about screen, and clearer copy
- [ ] Ship it!
