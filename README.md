I wanted to block Reddit and Hacker News on my iPhone but couldn't find any general-purpose domain blocking apps that I liked. So here's my take.

The app provides a Content Blocker extension which you have to enable in Safari preferences. You can then add/delete domains to block in the app. You can also use the Safari Action extension to add the website you're currently browsing to the blocklist.

Enjoy!
